Remeber, we have 3 authentications provided in the settings.py.

JWT, Session and Token.

So Django tries to authenticate the user in order the authentication is provided in the settings.py Authentication classes.

Now, if authentication classes is not provided in the view, the default is apllied.

JWT auth class and Browsable APIs can not work together. We have to rely on cCurl or Postman to work
with JWT based authentications.

How i made the bropwsable APIs work with JWT (well not really), for my views where I needed the data,
I have over-ridden the authentication_calsses to Session.
