# Django JavaScript Ajax jQuery Tailwind React Docker : "ProjectShadow"

A custom website to generate custom JSON data. Personal project. More details to follow.

## Project Summary

This project is a web application built using Django, a Python web framework. The application allows users to create test cases by selecting modules and submitting test steps. Each module represents a feature, and users can toggle values and submit steps using Django forms.

One of the main features of the project is the Cart functionality, where users can add test steps to a cart using JavaScript and Ajax. The cart allows users to gather multiple test steps before creating a test case. Once the desired steps are added to the cart, users can click the "Create Test Case" button to finalize the test case. This interaction is facilitated by jQuery, a JavaScript library known for its simplicity and powerful DOM manipulation capabilities.

The project utilizes various technologies and tools:

- **Django**: The web framework used to develop the application, providing the structure and functionality for handling requests, managing models, and rendering templates.

- **SQLite**: The default database backend in Django, used for storing application data.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the application, providing a flexible and customizable design system.

- **JavaScript**: Used to enhance the user experience, implement dynamic functionality, and interact with the server using Ajax calls.

- **Ajax**: A set of web development techniques that allows asynchronous communication between the client and server, enabling real-time updates and avoiding full page reloads.

- **jQuery**: A JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversal, event handling, and AJAX interactions. It provides an easy-to-use API for DOM manipulation and AJAX calls.

- **Docker**: Used for containerization, allowing for a consistent and isolated environment for running the application.

- **Python**: The primary programming language used in Django, providing the backend logic and driving the application's functionality.

- **React**: Using React to design responsive elements

The project aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly environment for creating and managing test cases within a web application. It leverages Django's powerful features, integrates JavaScript and jQuery for enhanced interactivity, uses Ajax for seamless server communication, and employs Docker for easy deployment and scalability.
