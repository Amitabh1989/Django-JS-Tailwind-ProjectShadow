A custom website to generate custom JSON data. Personal project. More details to follow.

**Project Summary**

This project is a web application built using Django, a Python web framework. The application allows users to create test cases by selecting modules and submitting test steps. Each module represents a feature, and users can toggle values and submit steps using Django forms.

One of the main features of the project is the Cart functionality, where users can add test steps to a cart using JavaScript. The cart allows users to gather multiple test steps before creating a test case. Once the desired steps are added to the cart, users can click the "Create Test Case" button to finalize the test case.

The project utilizes various technologies and tools:

- **Django**: The web framework used to develop the application, providing the structure and functionality for handling requests, managing models, and rendering templates.

- **SQLite**: The default database backend in Django, used for storing application data.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the application, providing a flexible and customizable design system.

- **JavaScript**: Used to enhance the user experience and implement dynamic functionality, particularly for the Cart feature.

- **Docker**: Used for containerization, allowing for a consistent and isolated environment for running the application.

- **Python**: The primary programming language used in Django, providing the backend logic and driving the application's functionality.

The project aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly environment for creating and managing test cases within a web application. It leverages Django's powerful features, integrates JavaScript for enhanced interactivity, and employs Docker for easy deployment and scalability.
